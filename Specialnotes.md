## Special Note:

Use Ubuntu while creating EC2 instance

Connect the instance and type `vim install.sh` (paste script, save and exit)

wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/releases/codedeploy-agent_1.3.2-1902_all.deb

Make sure to modify the Availability Zone according to your use, like here it is (us-east-1) for North Virginia.

If you are using Mumbai, then replace that place with (ap-south-1).

Type `bash install.sh`
